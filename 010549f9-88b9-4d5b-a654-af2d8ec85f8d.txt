A sprawling intergalactic battle unfolds on the surface of a shattered, ice-crusted planet orbiting a dying binary star. Massive star cruisers hover above jagged mountain ranges, their hulls scarred by laser fire, while swarms of sleek starfighters weave through turbulent plasma storms. In the foreground, a lone hero clad in tattered, futuristic armor stands atop a cliff of black crystalline ice, a glowing energy sword humming in their hand, reflecting the flickering light of distant explosions.
