[verse]
You always look far away.
choosing distant words.
But when you meet my gaze and smile so softly.
My heart stirs with excitement.
oh oh oh oh oh.
You make my gaze and smile softly.
I'm obsessed. excited.
Why do you always choose words that test me.
I wonder why this old boy touches you when your shadow slips away.
[chorus]
You. the little devil of a model jet.
Where does the true color lie.
The closer I get.
The farther you seem.
You. the little devil of a model jet.
Where does the true color lie.
The closer I get. the farther you seem.
For some reason. I can't reach your heart.
[verse]
You're always so indifferent. smiling coldly at me.
But sometimes with just a gesture.
I find myself bewildered. lost in this world.
And once again. I wanna distance myself.
Yet I can't.
I'm drowning in everything about you in your eyes.
I wish you would just be honest.
[chorus]
You. the little devil of a model jet.
Where does the true color lie. The closer I get.
The farther you seem.
You. the little devil of a model jet.
Where does the true color lie.
The closer I get. the farther you seem.
For some reason. I can't reach your heart.
